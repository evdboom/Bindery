# Bindery MCP — Desktop Extension (.mcpb)

Book authoring tools for Claude Desktop: chapter navigation, full-text search,
translation management, session memory, typography formatting, and version snapshots.
Works with any Markdown book project structured with the Bindery VS Code extension.

## Features

- **Chapter navigation** — jump to any chapter by number and language
- **Full-text search** — lexical BM25, semantic rerank, or full semantic search across the book corpus
- **Translation management** — list, look up, add, and update translation and dialect substitution rules
- **Session memory** — append, list, and compact persistent cross-session notes in `.bindery/memories/`
- **Workspace setup** — create or update `.bindery/settings.json` and scaffold AI instruction files
- **Chapter status tracking** — record and query per-chapter progress (draft, in-progress, done, needs-review)
- **Typography formatting** — curly quotes, em-dashes, ellipses
- **Workspace sync** — fetch and pull the current branch before a session, with branch/default-branch reporting
- **Version snapshots** — git-based save points after writing sessions
- **Review diffs** — structured git diff of uncommitted changes

## Manual Installation

To install manually without using published Claude Connectors

1. Download the `.mcpb` file from the latest release
2. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings** → **Extensions**
3. Click **Install from file** (or drag-drop the `.mcpb` file)
4. Fill in the **Books** field (see Configuration below)

## Configuration

| Setting | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Books | Yes | Semicolon-separated `Name=path` pairs pointing to book projects |
| Ollama URL | No | URL for Ollama instance (enables semantic reranking, see [https://docs.ollama.com/quickstart](https://docs.ollama.com/quickstart)) |
| Build full semantic index | No | `true` to let `index_build` precompute embeddings for `full_semantic` search |
| Default search mode | No | `lexical`, `semantic_rerank`, or `full_semantic` |

**Books** example: `MyBook=C:\Users\Me\MyBook;MyNovel=D:\Writing\MyNovel`

## Examples

### Navigate a book's structure

> "Show me the chapter list for my book"

Claude calls `list_books` to discover the book name, then `get_overview` to show
all acts and chapters with titles.

### Search for a character's mentions

> "Where does Landa first meet the Keeper?"

Claude calls `search` with the query and returns the most relevant passages with file paths and line numbers, letting you jump straight to the scene.

If `full_semantic` is enabled and the semantic index is stale, Claude should call `index_status`, then recommend `index_build` before relying on semantic results.

### Add a dialect substitution rule

> "Add a substitution: 'color' should become 'colour' in en-gb"

Claude calls `add_dialect` with `dialectCode: "en-gb"`, `from: "color"`,
`to: "colour"`. The rule is saved to `.bindery/translations.json` and applied
automatically during future exports.

### Review and snapshot your changes

> "Review my changes and save a snapshot if they look good"

Claude calls `get_review_text` to show the diff, reviews it, then calls
`git_snapshot` to commit the changes with a descriptive message. If you have configured a preferred push target, the same call can also push the snapshot.

### Sync the workspace before reading in

> "Update this workspace before we start"

Claude calls `update_workspace` to fetch and pull the current branch. If the current branch differs from the remote default branch, the tool reports that so Claude can ask whether to switch before continuing.

### Look up a glossary term

> "How is 'flux' translated in the Dutch version?"

Claude calls `get_translation` with `language: "nl"` and `word: "flux"`. The
lookup is forgiving — it matches case-insensitively and checks plural and
inflected forms automatically. If no glossary entry exists yet, Claude can call
`add_translation` with `targetLangCode: "nl"` to create one.

### List all dialect substitution rules

> "Show me all the British English substitution rules"

Claude calls `get_dialect` with `dialectCode: "en-gb"` (omitting `word`) to dump every `from → to` rule in the `en-gb` entry of `.bindery/translations.json`.
Useful before an export session to see what spelling substitutions are configured.

### Save session decisions to memory

> "Save today's character decisions to memory"

Claude calls `memory_list` to check which files already exist and their sizes,
then calls `memory_append` with `file: "global.md"`, a short title, and the
decisions to record. The tool stamps the current date automatically — no manual
date formatting needed.

### Compact a memory file that has grown too large

> "The global memory file is getting long — please compact it"

Claude reads the current content, summarizes it, then calls `memory_compact`
with the compacted text. The original is automatically backed up to
`.bindery/memories/archive/global_YYYY-MM-DD.md` before the file is overwritten.

### Spot-check a chapter translation

> "Compare chapter 10 in EN and NL and flag any translation issues"

Claude calls `get_chapter` twice — once for EN, once for NL — then calls
`get_translation` with the target language to load the known term table.
Discrepancies are presented in a side-by-side table. Any confirmed corrections
are saved back with `add_translation` (glossary) or `add_dialect` (dialect substitutions).

### Check continuity across chapters

> "Check chapter 8 for consistency errors — character descriptions and world rules"

Claude calls `get_book_until` to load prior chapters through the focus chapter,
uses `get_notes` to load character profiles and world rules, then uses `search`
to verify specific details against earlier chapters. Results are presented in a
table with issue type, location, and the reference that contradicts it.

configure an Ollama URL, embedding requests are sent to that configured instance only.
